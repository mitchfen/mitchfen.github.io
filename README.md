## Overview

- Displays all my links and projects: [mitchfen.xyz](https://mitchfen.xyz)

- I was using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), but I wanted to learn more about these technologies.

## GitHub Actions ðŸš€

- When code is pushed to the master branch, the CI/CD workflow outlined in publish.yaml executes:
  - Clone the repo to an Ubuntu environment
  - Setup Node.js and install dependencies
  - Build the project, including CNAME and 404.html
  - Publish to the gh-pages branch
